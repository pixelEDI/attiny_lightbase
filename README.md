# General info



## Code

## Hardware
- This DIY nightlight is a practical example of using transistors with ATtinys since we address 4 LEDs with one GPIO, with max 40mA per pin.
- The light is switched on and off from the hardware side with a built-in reed switch and a magnet.
- The microphone functions as a sound detector so you can change between three colors by clapping. 
- We added 100ohm resistors for the LEDs and 1kohm for the transistor (on the base).
- The transistors are a NPN Type with 100mA IC
