## General info 
This DIY nightlight is a practical example of using transistors with ATtinys. 

The light is switched on and off from the hardware side with a built-in reed switch and a magnet. 

You can change between three colors by clapping.

reedswitch and magnet tunr on off the circuit
practicle example for using transisotros with attinys
4 leds on one gpio of attiny would probaly damage the pin - > max 40mA pro / PIN
microphone = sound detection for clapping detection...
resistor for led = 100ohm
transistor is kohm on base
bim
npn transistor with 100mA IC
